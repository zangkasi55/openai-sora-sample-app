This repository is a fork of [openai/openai-sora-sample-app](https://github.com/openai/openai-sora-sample-app) with adjustments to use Azure OpenAI instead of the standard OpenAI API.

# Sora Video API sample app

This repository contains a NextJS sample app built on top of Azure OpenAI Sora, GPT-image-2, and MAI-Image-2 deployments hosted in New Microsoft Foundry resources.
It provides a UI for experimentation, using text prompts and optionally image inputs to generate images, generate videos, and remix videos.

![Sora demo visual](./public/sora-demo-visual.jpg)

Features:

- Generate new videos or remix existing runs through Azure OpenAI Sora endpoints.
- Queue multiple variations in one click with **Versions Count** and follow progress via automatic polling.
- Auto-title runs so finished clips stay recognizable.
- Automatically optimize prompts for video and image generation.
- Generate images with GPT-image-2 or MAI-Image-2.
- Send uploaded reference images to GPT-image-2 image edits for new image creation.
- Use GPT-image-2 prompt templates to prefill and fine-tune prompts.
- Preview, download, remix, or retry completed runs directly from the history panel.
- Persist preferences and run history in `localStorage` so refreshes do not wipe context.
- Emit application telemetry to Application Insights and Azure Monitor.

See [docs/project-spec.md](docs/project-spec.md) for the detailed architecture, model routing, Azure resources, monitoring design, and diagrams.

This app is meant to be used as a starting point to build Sora-powered video experiences that you can customize to your needs.

## How to use

1. **Get access to the Sora Video API:**

   - Sora is currently in limited availability. Request access through your OpenAI account team or the [Video API waitlist](https://openai.com/waitlist/sora).
   - Once approved, review the [video generation guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/video-generation) to understand supported parameters and limits.

2. **Set the OpenAI API key:**

   2 options:

   - Export the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable [globally on your machine](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries#create-and-export-an-api-key).
   - Create a `.env.local` file at the project root (see below)

   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
   ```

3. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/openai/sora-starter-app.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   Run in the project root:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Run the app:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

## Video helpers

This sample app highlights common Sora workflows and wraps each one in a small UI helper to speed up iteration.

### Generate new videos

- Fill in your prompt, choose `sora-2`, aspect ratio, and duration (4s, 8s, or 12s).
- Optionally upload an image; the app crops it to the chosen aspect ratio before sending it along as `input_reference`.
- Submit one or many variations at once via **Versions Count**. The sidebar polls `/videos/{id}` until each job completes.

### Remix existing runs

- Paste an existing `video_id` into the Remix section or click **Remix** on a completed run.
- Adjust prompt, model, size, or duration and resubmit. The history keeps both parent and remix entries linked for fast comparison.

### Prompt optimization

Use **Generate prompt** to call the Responses API to optimize your prompt for the selected model, size, and duration.

### Image generation

- Use the Image tab to generate images with GPT-image-2 or MAI-Image-2.
- Attach a reference image to use GPT-image-2 edits and preserve the uploaded subject in a newly generated image.
- Preview, download, or reuse generated images as references.

### Run management

- Preview, download, remix, or retry finished runs without leaving the page.
- Remove unwanted runs from the history and bulk download completed clips.

## Demo flows

### Try a fresh generation

- Enter a descriptive prompt such as `A sweeping drone shot over neon-drenched Kyoto at night`.
- Select `sora-2`, set duration to 8 seconds, and bump **Versions Count** to 3.
- Click **Generate**. Watch each run stream through queued → processing → completed states, then preview the outputs inline.

### Try a remix

- Pick your favorite completed clip and hit **Remix**.
- Add guidance like `with a vintage film grain feel` and submit. Compare the remix to the original using the preview overlay navigation.

### Try prompt and image suggestions

- Click **Suggest prompt** after entering a rough idea—e.g., `A playful golden retriever in the snow`—and apply the refined version.
- Ask for image ideas, select one of the generated stills, and run a new generation to see how the reference shapes the motion.
